# Euphoria Cloth Shopping App

Welcome to Euphoria, a cloth shopping app built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Zustand! Euphoria provides a complete shopping experience by mimicking an e-commerce application. It allows users to browse through a variety of clothing items, add them to their cart, and simulate the checkout process. Please note that this app does not have a backend or database; instead, it temporarily stores data in state for demonstration purposes.
